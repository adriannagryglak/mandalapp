Mandalapp is my first React app and a tool to design your own mandala pattern. User has full control over elements- its amount, size and type, all structured in layers. Nature has always inspired me deeply, so as mandala particles I choosed elements of plants (petals, leaves, cones), from Pexels images. I hope to replace it with real life plant scans someday. 
##### _please have in mind that its still work-in-progress_
