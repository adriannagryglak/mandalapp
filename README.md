# MANDALAPP
## _create your own mandala collage_
##
##
Mandalapp is my first React app and fun tool to design your own mandala pattern and save it as an image. User has full control over elements- its amount, size and type, all structured in layers. Nature has always inspired me deeply, so as mandala particles I choosed elements of plants (petals, leaves, cones), from Pexels images. I hope to replace it with real life plant scans in the future.
